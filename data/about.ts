		context: 'An Electronic Logging Device (ELD) is a piece of hardware used in commercial motor vehicles to automatically record a driver\'s driving time and Hours of Service (HOS). ELDs are designed to replace traditional paper logs, providing a more accurate, tamper-resistant method for tracking compliance with federal regulations.\n \n The ELD synchronizes with a vehicle’s engine to capture essential data such as engine power status, vehicle motion, miles driven, and time. Additionally, it allows drivers to log their on-duty, off-duty, and driving hours with minimal manual input. This helps ensure that commercial drivers are adhering to safety regulations that prevent fatigue-related accidents.'
